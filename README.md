Python Wiki for ORIE majors @ Cornell

Everything you need to know about Python for ORIE at Cornell, including `pandas`, OR-Tools, GurobiPy, and more!

## TODO

 - [x] Find a good way to have syntax highlighting work in pure HTML (using pygments with default style incorporated into `style.css`)
 - [x] create a favicon that works
 - [x] make the sidebar into a hamburger menu on mobile (instead did something with css that made mobile usable)
 - [ ] Courses: finish courses besides ENGRI 1101 (me: 2700, 3120, 3150, 3300, 3310, 3500, 3510, 4330, 4350, 4390, 4580, 4630, 4741, 4820, 4990); remove all course links not present
 - [ ] Concepts: do all examples
 - [ ] Tools: finish tool pages (anaconda, colab, jupyter); write up general advice for events/ilps
