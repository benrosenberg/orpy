Course description (from class roster):
<div class="class-description">
    <p>
        Introduction to the problems and methods of operations research and information engineering focusing on problem areas (including inventory, network design, and resource allocation), the situations in which these problems arise, and several standard solution techniques. In the computational laboratory, students encounter problem simulations and use some standard commercial software packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Offered:</b> Fall, Spring.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Permission note:</b> Not open to ORIE upper-level majors.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Outcomes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the breadth of quantitative decision situations that arise in engineering, industry, and society.</li>
            <li>Develop the skills needed for mathematical modeling of real-world decision situations.</li>
            <li>Learn fundamental algorithms used to solve such models and the basic mathematical techniques of validating the accuracy and efficiency of these solution methods.</li>
            <li>Build familiarity with current software used in the computational analysis of these models.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Is Python used?</h2>

Yes, but it's complicated. ENGRI 1101 is taught by different professors depending on the semester. One of the professors, Brenda Dietrich, prefers <a href="https://ampl.com/">AMPL</a> to Python, but Python should still be available as a choice to students. For all other professors, Python is used exclusively.

<h2>If Python is used, where is it used?</h2>

Python is used in labs. It is not used anywhere else; homework needs to be done by hand. (This may vary for Dietrich semesters.)

<h2>What is Python used for?</h2>

Most of the Python is in Jupyter Notebooks, which contain demonstrations of algorithms and some ILP (Integer Linear Program) formulations (done in OR-Tools.) (This may vary for Dietrich semesters.)

<h2>What do I need to know?</h2>

Nothing. There are no CS prerequisites; if you're taking CS 1110 you may have a small leg up but it's not necessary.
