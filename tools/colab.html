<h1>Google Colab</h1>

<p>
  Google Colab is an online version of <a href="jupyter.html">Jupyter Notebook</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
  Since Colab is all online, there's no need to install anything. Simply visit <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">https://colab.research.google.com/</a> to start. Note that this uses your currently-signed-in Google account.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>
  You can use Colab pretty much the same way as you use Jupyter Notebook.
</p>

<h2>Comparison with Jupyter Notebook</h2>

<p>
  Here are the main pros and cons of Jupyter Notebook and Colab:
  <table>
    <caption>Jupyter Notebook vs Colab</caption>
    <tr>
        <th scope="col"></th>
        <th scope="col">Jupyter Notebook</th>
        <th scope="col">Google Colab</th>

    <tr>
        <td scope="row">
          Pros
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Gets installed locally, so it doesn't require internet</li>
            <li>Easier to use files on your local disk</li>
            <li>Can be faster/more responsive depending on your computer's specs</li>
            <li>Is more customizable (you can have custom themes, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>No need to install anything (can save a lot of headaches)</li>
            <li>Works well with Google Drive (that's where files are stored)</li>
            <li>Easier to collaborate than with Jupyter Notebook</li>
            <li>Doesn't freeze up your computer when running intensive tasks as everything's done in the cloud</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td scope="row">
        Cons
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Gets installed locally, so installation process can be annoying</li>
          <li>Difficult to collaborate with others</li>
          <li>Can be slower or impossible to run depending on your computer's specs</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>Files are stored using Google Drive; if you want to use files from your computer you need to upload them yourself. And you need to upload them again next time you run the notebook.</li>
          <li>Collaboration can be a pain; you may occasionally lose progress due to poor (nonexistent?) same-time editing support.</li>
          <li>Can be much slower because everything is done in the cloud, which has usage limits as well</li>
          <li>Not a very customizable experience</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
